# tech-promises
A collection of frameworks and languages I want to invest time in.
I think they cover a broad spectrum and are intended to be so.
I would like to invest more time in increasing my DevOps skills and become even more of a T-shaped developer than now.
In reality I would like to be more of Russian letter 'ле' developer with having a really solid understanding of at least one language in each of backend, frontend and a free option.
